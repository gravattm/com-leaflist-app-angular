              LeafList
              experience, including, but not limited to, powering our rating system and algorithm (which displays a

              offered. We do not sell, rent, or lease our user or Member lists to third parties. However,

              producing
              aggregate insights that do not identify you. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external
              business
              partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. We may share data with trusted

              to
              LeafList,

              indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. We will disclose your personal
              information, without
              notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
              (a)
              conform to
              the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on LeafList or the site; (b) protect and defend
              the rights

              that you

            <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
            <p>Our Services may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file
              that is
              placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses
              to
              your
              computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that
              issued the
              cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you
              time.
              The
              purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if
              you
              personalize any of the Services, or register with the LeafList site or Services, a cookie helps us to
              recall your
              specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the Services, the information you
              previously
              provided
              can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. You have the ability to accept
              or
              decline
              cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
              to
              decline
              cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you should still be able to fully use our
              Services.</p>
